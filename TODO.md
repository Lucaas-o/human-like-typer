# Additional Suggestions (Not Directly in the Code)

## User-Editable Config Profiles
- Allow users to save and switch between different configurations (for example, "work", "personal", etc.) to quickly change settings without reconfiguring every time.

## Logging
- Implement logging to a file (using Pythonâ€™s built-in logging module) to capture events, errors, and user actions.
- This can help in troubleshooting issues when the compiled executable is used.

## Command-Line Arguments
- Enable command-line arguments to override settings or start the program in a specific mode.
- This can be done with modules like `argparse`.

## Dynamic Language Update
- Consider updating the language translations without restarting the program.
- Implement a command that reloads the config and refreshes the current language.

## Customizable Typing Patterns
- Allow more fine-tuning of typing behavior.
  - Varying delays for punctuation, special keys.
  - Simulating occasional mistakes.

## Graphical Interface
- Enhance usability by implementing a simple GUI.
- Use a framework like Tkinter for configuration instead of relying solely on command-line prompts.
